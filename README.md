Perceptron Learning Algorithm

This octave code will:
 - pick a separation line L, 
 - generate a random set D from a 2-dimensional RxR,
 - classify D using L: above/below
 - run PLA algorithm on the set D
 - plot estimated separation line


How to run:

Running:

    simpla(50);

will perform the above actions setting the sample size to 50.
